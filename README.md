# What is this?

This is a report made for a data analysis class. Different performance statistics in electric vehicles are compared and compiled into graphs and tables using the python libraries matplotlib and seaborn. Observations aim to aid the reader in deciding which electric vehicle is right for them. The dataset used is provided as a csv file and the report is provided as a jupyter notebook written in python. A few small changes were made from this version compared to what was submitted (adding this readme file, updating code to account for deprecated library features, etc.).

If you don't wish to compile the notebook yourself I've formatted the report as a pdf using LaTeX. You can view the LaTeX code under the 'LaTeX Resources' folder.

**The notebook was written and tested in the jupyter lab extension for vsc, if anything seems out of place running the file in another environment consider switching to vsc.**
